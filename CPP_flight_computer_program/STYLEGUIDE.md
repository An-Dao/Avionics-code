## headers

- arrange headers in a descending order, in case of same length use alphabetical order


## indents

- in line tab indents, that means you indent after a command block like in Python and then continue in line

```
    if (condition == true)
        {
        foobar();
        }
```

- use tabs to indent, 1 tab = 4 spaces


## functions

- leave a new line to separate two function def blocks


## variables

- every variable has a default value! I don't wanna be dealing undefined behaviour!

## print statements

- every debug print statement should have a tag indicating what it is in reference to 
    Example
        [ROCKET STATE] => indicates the statement is for debugging rocket state
        [KX134] => indicates debugging for the respective sensor
